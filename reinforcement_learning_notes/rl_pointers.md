## 🧠 Notes: How to Train an Agent with RL for Dataset Cleaning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) for structured tasks like dataset cleaning doesn't rely on next-token prediction like LLMs — instead, it's based on:

### 🔁 Core Concept
> The agent learns through **interaction**, getting a **reward** signal for each action or sequence of actions.

---

### 🧹 Example: Dataset Cleaning Loop
Imagine the agent does:

1. Load raw DataFrame
2. Decide to remove nulls vs. impute
3. Apply type casting, column renaming, or outlier trimming
4. Save result

Each step = **an action** in the environment.

### 🏗️ How to Structure Logs for RL Training
These are the fields to log for each step (and eventually use for training):

```json
{
  "state": "summary of DataFrame before step",
  "action": "handle_missing_values(fill_strategy='mean')",
  "observation": "DataFrame with no missing values",
  "reward": 0.8,
  "next_state": "summary of new DataFrame",
  "done": false
}
```

| Field        | Purpose                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `state`      | Encoded form of the DF (e.g. stats/shape) |
| `action`     | Tool call string or JSON of args          |
| `observation`| Result of the action                      |
| `reward`     | How good was the outcome (score!)         |
| `next_state` | Post-action snapshot                      |
| `done`       | True if end of cleaning sequence          |

---

### 🎯 Reward Strategies (Ideas)
You must define a reward function! For cleaning, examples:

- ✅ Higher reward if missing values decrease
- ✅ Higher reward if numerical columns are restored correctly
- ❌ Penalty if column dropped that was important
- ❌ Penalty if standard deviation becomes NaN

---

### 🧪 Down the Line
Once I've logged enough (like 1000+ cleaning sessions), you can train:

- A **policy model** that maps state → best next action
- Possibly using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** or **Q-learning**
- With tools like [RLHF libraries](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl) or Hugging Face's `trl`

---

### ✅ Immediate Goals
- Start logging `state`, `action`, `reward`, and `result` NOW.
- Encode `state` using summary stats (e.g. `df.describe().to_json()`)
- Use `tool_name` + `params` as `action`
- Store in a `.jsonl` log file like: `cleaning_episodes.jsonl`
