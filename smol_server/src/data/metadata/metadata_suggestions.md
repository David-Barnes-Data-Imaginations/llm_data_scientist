## Implementation Suggestions:

### **For Your Workflow:**
1. **Metadata Versioning**: Include version control for metadata itself
2. **Tool-Specific Sections**: Separate sections for different tool types (pandas, visualization, ML)
3. **Validation Schemas**: JSON schemas for automated metadata validation
4. **Context Windows**: Mark which sections are most critical for different analysis types

### **Small Model Optimization:**
1. **Chunking Hints**: Indicate how data should be segmented for processing
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Mark which analyses can build on simpler ones
3. **Error Recovery**: Expected error patterns and handling strategies
4. **Quality Checkpoints**: Where to validate intermediate results

This extended metadata will make your datasets much more "conversation-ready" for LLM tools, especially when you need 
to break complex analyses into smaller, manageable pieces for smaller models. The semantic classifications and tool 
hints will be particularly valuable for automated workflow generation.
